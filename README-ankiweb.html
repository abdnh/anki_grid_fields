Allows you to display the editor in multiple columns, or any arrangement you want.

It knows three modes:
<ol><li><b>Auto Columns</b>: It will generate the appropriate amount of columns for you, depending on the width of the editor window. It is active, when the column number is set to <b>0</b>.</li><li><b>Grid Columns</b>: You can also manually set the amount of columns per hand (in the editor toolbar). This is the behavior, when the column number is set to <b>1 - 9</b></li><li><b>Grid Areas</b>: <i>Advanced feature</i>. You can define how the fields are displayed yourself. You can set this behavior under "Editor &gt; Fields &gt; Grid". If you enable it, it will overwrite the Auto columns as the behavior when the column number is set to <b>0</b>. See below for more details.</li></ol>
Auto Columns in a smaller window, and in a bigger window. Notice the "Cols" toggle in the toolbar for setting the column count by hand:

Grid areas:

This arrangement would have the definition:<code>
f1 f1 f2
f3 f4 f5
f6 f7 f5</code>
This definition is what you have to enter into the dialog under "Editor &gt; Fields &gt; Grid".

<b>Shortcuts</b>
<ul><li><b>F12</b>: Toggle between <b>Auto columns</b> and <b>Grid areas</b> in the editor.</li><li><b>Shift+F12</b>: Make a field <b>temporarily full width</b> (works well with Auto/Grid Columns, will obscure fields when using Grid areas).</li></ul>You can set those shortcuts under "Tools &gt; Add-ons &gt; Grid Fields &gt; Config".
