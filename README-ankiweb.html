Allows you to display the editor in multiple columns, or any arrangement you want.

It knows two modes:
<ol><li><b>Grid Columns</b>: It will generate columns for you. If you set the column number to <b>0</b>, it will automatically adjust to the width of the editor window. You can also adjust the amount of columns per hand (in the editor toolbar). This is the default behavior.</li><li><b>Grid areas</b>: You can define the areas how the fields are displayed yourself. You can set this behavior under "Editor &gt; Fields &gt; Grid". See below for more details.</li></ol>
Columns in a smaller window, and in a bigger window. Notice the "Cols" toggle in the toolbar for setting the column count by hand:

Grid areas:

This arrangement would have the definition:
<code>f1 f1 f2
f3 f4 f5
f6 f7 f5</code>
This definition is what you have to enter into the dialog under "Editor &gt; Fields &gt; Grid".

You can use <b>F12</b> to toggle between <b>Grid columns</b> and <b>Grid areas</b> in the editor.
You can use <b>Shift+F12</b> to make a field <b>temporarily full width</b> (works with Grid Columns, not always with Grid areas).
You can set those shortcuts under "Tools &gt; Add-ons &gt; Grid Fields &gt; Config".
