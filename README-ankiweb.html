Allows you to display the editor in multiple columns, or any arrangement you want.

It knows two modes:
<ol><li><b>Auto Columns</b>: It will generate columns for you, which automatically adjust to the width of the editor window. This is the default behavior.</li><li><b>Grid areas</b>: You can define the areas how the fields are displayed yourself. You can set this behavior under "Editor &gt; Fields &gt; Grid". See below for more details.</li></ol>
Auto columns in a smaller window, and in a bigger window:

Grid areas:

This arrangement would have the definition:
<code>f1 f1 f2
f3 f4 f5
f6 f7 f5</code>
This definition is what you have to enter into the dialog under "Editor &gt; Fields &gt; Grid".

You can use <b>F10</b> to toggle between both modes in the editor.
